# XRPL Integration Guide

This document outlines how our DEX interacts with the XRP Ledger Testnet.

## Wallet Creation and Management
- We use the `xrpl.wallet.generate_faucet_wallet()` function to create new wallets on the testnet.
- Multisignature wallets are implemented for enhanced security.

## Transaction Submission
- Transactions are submitted using the `submit_and_wait()` function from the xrpl library.
- We verify transaction signatures before submission.

## Account Information
- We fetch account sequences using the `AccountInfo` request.
- Current ledger information is retrieved using the `LedgerCurrent` request.

## Payment Processing
- Payments are created using the `Payment` model from xrpl.models.transactions.
- We use `autofill_and_sign()` to prepare transactions for submission.

## Error Handling
- We implement robust error handling for all XRPL interactions.
- Errors are logged for debugging purposes.

## Best Practices
- We follow XRPL best practices for transaction submission and account management.
- Regular balance checks are performed to ensure sufficient funds for operations.
