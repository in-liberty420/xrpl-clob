# Architecture Overview

Our Decentralized Exchange (DEX) on the XRP Ledger consists of several key components:

## 1. Order Book
- Maintains the current state of all active orders.
- Implements efficient data structures for fast updates and retrievals.

## 2. Matching Engine
- Runs batch auctions at regular intervals (currently every 15 seconds).
- Implements a pro-rata matching algorithm for fair order execution.
- Handles partial fills and order expiration.

## 3. Settlement System
- Interacts with the XRP Ledger to execute matched trades.
- Handles the creation and submission of payment transactions.
- Manages multisignature wallet operations for enhanced security.

## 4. API Layer
- Provides RESTful endpoints for order placement and order book queries.
- Implements input validation and error handling.

## 5. XRPL Integration
- Manages all interactions with the XRP Ledger.
- Handles wallet creation, transaction submission, and account queries.

## Data Flow
1. Users submit orders via the API.
2. Orders are stored in the Order Book.
3. The Matching Engine periodically processes orders in batch auctions.
4. Matched orders are sent to the Settlement System.
5. The Settlement System executes trades on the XRP Ledger.
6. The Order Book is updated with the results.

## Security Considerations
- Multisignature wallets are used for holding funds.
- All transactions are verified before submission.
